# 🧠 Small Basic React Projects

This repository contains a collection of small React projects I built while learning the **fundamentals of React** and frontend development. Each project is in its own folder and focuses on practicing different core concepts of modern React and styling.

## 📚 What I Practiced

While working on these projects, I focused on learning and applying the following concepts:

### ⚛️ React Core Concepts:

- **Props and State**
- **Event Handling**
- **JSX and Conditional Rendering**
- **useState & useEffect Hooks**
- **React Router DOM** (Navigation & Routing)
- **Pages & Layouts**
- **Context API** (for global state)
- **Redux Toolkit** (basic state management)

### 🌐 API & Data Handling:
- **Fetching data from APIs**
- **Understanding how APIs work in real frontend apps**

### 🎨 Styling & UI:
- **Tailwind CSS** (for utility-first responsive styling)
